# What are Git and Github?

Git is version control software. Version control systems allow you to manage and keep track of your source code history.
GitHub is a cloud-based hosting service that lets you manage and share Git repositories.

VS Code comes with a git GUI - a graphical user interface.

1. [Install git](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
2. Create a GitHub account.
3. Configure git as per the [instructions on the platform](https://login.codingdojo.com/m/201/7499/53121).
4. Open your project folder in VS Code. It should be the **only folder open**.
5. Click the source control icon to toggle open the source control pane.
6. Click the button to initialize a local repository in the project folder (git init).
7. Click the plus sign(s) next to the files you want to stage (git add).
8. Write a meaningful message and click the checkmark (git commit).
9. Click publish (if you want others to be able to see it, make it public).
10. Profit.
